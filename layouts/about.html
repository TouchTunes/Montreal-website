   					<p>Our story began right here in Montreal in 1998 with the development of the world’s first pay-for-play digital jukebox. Since then, we have transformed into a multi-application platform offering a variety of engaging and interactive experiences. TouchTunes is one of only a few companies able to deliver end-to-end in-venue interactive entertainment solutions, encompassing hardware, software and network operations. </p>

And if she had her way, Montreal would treat citizens to a day off and free everything on your birthday. Vote for Malena! She also happens to have a heart of a gold and some serious superhero aspirations and if given a day of immortality, she’d spend it as human shield protecting others. Malena is currently doing some recon to figure out WHO Waldo is before she can find him...</p>

And if given immortality for a day she would probably just wait it out until she was mortal again. Enlightenment level 500 folks! Najeia has yet to find Waldo but her best guess is Vegas, because what happens in Vegas…</p>

					<p>As an optimist, Pascal would rub branches together to the beat of “Never give you up” by Rick Astley to make a fire if he were ever stuck on a deserted island. He says the worst gift he ever got was a Swiss army knife because “What good is that for?” Bet that gift would’ve come in handy on that deserted island, hey Pascal?! But he didn’t need that boy scout knife to find Waldo. According to Pascal, he’s behind you! </p>

					<p>In case you’re ever looking for Rémi on a not-so-lazy Sunday in Montreal, he’s probably playing Ultimate Frisbee in pretty much any park in the city. Just follow the sounds of some DJ Easy Rock or any 80’s rap or some Jamaican Ska playing on blast and you’ll find him. If only genetics came with a gift receipt, Rémi says the worst gift he ever got was bad back (Thanks Mom!) As for Waldo, he figures he’s somewhere with all the missing left socks of the world, gone through the black hole that is the dryer…</p>

					<p>A lover of knowledge, if Ben could pass 1 city law, he’d require that everyone read at least 1 new book a month. Good luck slow readers! If he were immortal for a day, he would strap on some metal armor, giddy up and go for a couple rounds of jousting. Our money is on Ben! Ben is tired of people asking “Where’s Waldo?” Nobody seems to be asking HOW is Waldo? Is no one concerned about his welfare? Don’t worry Waldo, Ben’s there for you.</p>

					<p>Yien You is all about getting in touch with his inner Mexican at 3 Amigos on a #lazysunday because nothing says lazy Sunday in Montreal quite like nachos and sombreros. And if given 24 hours of immortality, he would fight Floyd Mayweather “If only to get 1 good hit, I’d take the KO”. He once received an umbrella with a hole in it as a present. Not cool. Yien You says Waldo is retired, chilling on a beach somewhere. </p>

					<p>Patrice wants one thing out of life; to be able to turn right at a red light in Montreal! And if he was given 24hrs of immortality, he’d spend the day turning right at all red lights. He once cleverly told his teacher he didn’t have his homework due to daylight savings, he was sure he gained a day (never mind an hour). Safe to say the teacher didn’t buy it but got a good laugh and gave him an ‘F’. Patrice is sure he spotted Waldo hanging out with Carmen San Diego, those two sure know how to blend in.</p>

					<p>A logical man, Ken would opt for the theme song from Gilligan’s island if ever stranded on a deserted island. Because it just makes sense, right? If he were to be immortal for the day he would simply use his god-like state to recover from a night at a Me, Mom and Morgentaler reunion concert the night before.  Ken pleaded the 5th when looking for Waldo (We think he’s a double agent…)</p>

If he could pass 1 city law, he would wipe Montreal clean of all motor vehicles and say goodbye to traffic once and for all. Group jogging anyone? According to Ludwig, if you’re looking for Waldo, check with Charlie.</p>

					<p>Resident old soul, Quentin would spend his days playing monopoly (classic edition) with his 2 kids and his nights kicking back to the soothing sounds of Frank Sinatra’s Strangers In The Night on his deserted island. And if given the chance, he would pass a law in Montreal requiring all citizens to own “at least 1” bike, next step would be getting them to use it… He also happens to think that the reason no one is able to find Waldo is because he stayed stuck in 1984.</p>

					<p>For Jerry, it’s the simple things in life. Like passing laws to give free metro rides to people wearing Chuck Taylors (totally justifiable) and rocking out to some classic 80s Queen. He’s all about the “Good Vibrations” just don’t gift him with a cassette tape of the Beach Boys greatest hits (it wasn’t pretty). Jerry found Waldo here: 44.4800° N, 69.1200° W</p>
