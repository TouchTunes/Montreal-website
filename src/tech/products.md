Our product engineers are the battle-tested storm chasers of the company, the elite unit we send in to engage seas of code, tsunamis of audio signals, and hurricanes of pixels. They have become Zen warriors in their fight for clean and intelligent design. These dedicated individuals come together to commune with the Linux kernel, be one with multimedia streams, and paint pixels with the expert hands of artists working with the most efficient tools to achieve the beauty of a piece of code. Their missions result in parties continuing without a hitch, people dancing to the beat of millions of tracks being played every day, and lives made just a little brighter through the power of a great song.
