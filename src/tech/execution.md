Ever spent time watching an ant colony self-organize around obstacles? We did (on the Internet), and it gave us (mostly the Lego maniacs) a few ideas. We started thinking, if ants had Lego, they would rule the world. Trust us, this is going somewhere.
We wanted to build resiliency and self-repair into our system, so we packed our code inside Docker images and let the containers re-arrange themselves so that we wouldnâ€™t have to. It's like automated Lego construction with data. All hail our ingenious ant overlords!
