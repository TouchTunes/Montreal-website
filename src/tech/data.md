"If a tree falls in a forest and nobody's around to hear it, does it make a sound?‚Äù With our RabbitMQ server, the answer is yes - that falling tree notified our messaging system so that everyone knows. Better yet, we know when every leaf falls and where it's going to hit the forest floor. We are not talking about one lonely zen tree of information here, picture a rain forest with a torrential downpour of data whirling around constantly. Our messaging strategy is the backbone of our platform. Our platform is the foundation of our products. Our products are everywhere. Do the math.
