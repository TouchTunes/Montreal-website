TouchTunes is looking for a battle-tested Producer to lead its mobile team and mobile app to new heights in 2016.

This includes working closely with the Product Management team (based in New York) to plan out and execute the business strategy and product evolution of the Mobile App.


### Desired Skills and Experience:

- The Mobile Producer must bring with them a proven track record of charismatic leadership, technical expertise and business acumen.
- 5 to 10 years of experience in project and team management, including working closely with other teams within an organization (Product, QA, Marketing, Sales, etc…)
- Technical expertise in mobile app development and online UI/UX design
- A strong understanding of client/server relationships, in order to work with the Platform Team in Montreal that develops TouchTunes’ APIs
- Mastery of the Agile development environment and the ability to handle the frequent changes it entails
- Experience with consumer-centric products and/or game development is a plus.
